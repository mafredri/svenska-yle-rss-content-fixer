# svenska-yle-rss-content-fixer

This little tool attaches article content to the Svenska Yle RSS feed... because they don't.

This was a quick hack so that I don't have to open every article in the browser. It doesn't (yet? PRs welcome) handle all content properly, some things may look off.

**PS.** If someone from Svenska Yle sees this, please, PLEASE, P. L. E. A. S. E. start including content in your RSS feed. No content defeats the purpose of RSS and even the Finnish side of Yle is including content.

**PPS.** Samma pÃ¥ svenska.
